# Brandon's Java Dojo
Honing my java skills in the dojo

### Goals:
- to create a nice source of reference material for myself (or anyone that comes across this)
- answer some common interview questions I have gotten (the kind without an NDA)
- code snippets where relevant
- some code challenges I've used as practice (the applications of the algorithm section)


### What this is NOT:
- an all encompassing resource
- a replacement for a textbook
